			<p>All dogs with a bite history should be evaluated by a veterinarian, ideally a veterinary behaviorist, to rule out pain, neurological issues, and other medical reasons for aggression. Many cases of reactivity and anxiety can improve with classical and operant conditioning, but some dogs require chemical intervention in the form of medication or supplements to correct chemical imbalances or slow down the nervous system so that training can take effect.</p>
			<p>Recommendations for veterinarians include but are not limited to;</p>
			<p>Buckley Veterinary Hospital (360) 829-1515</p>
			<p>Tahoma Veterinary Hospital (253) 847-3500</p>
			<p>Additionally, all dogs should be up to date on vaccinations, particularly if participating in group classes is a goal. There are many vaccine clinics in the south Puget Sound area that can help if you need to update your dog's vaccines, or are unsure of what your dog's vaccine status actually is. For more information, send an email!</p>
